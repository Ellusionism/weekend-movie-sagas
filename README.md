# Project Name

Movies Sagas Weekend Challenge

## Description

Duration - 2 day sprint

The requirements for this assignment were to take a database of movies and genres, and display the information a movie selected from a list. To do this, I used Sagas, React, Redux and SQL to get and store the information from the database, in such a way that the genres could be displayed with each movie's details.

## Usage

The homepage shows a gallery of movies from the database. By clicking on a movie's div, you can view the description and genres for the selected movie. The 'Back to List' button will return you to the gallery page.

Built with:
-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-Node.js
-React
-Redux
-Sagas
-PostgreSQL
